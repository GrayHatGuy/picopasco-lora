  #### *- to feed oneself a little bit*

 ## description
LoRaWAN connectivity via SX1262 with sensor monitor and control hardware/firmware for a personal economical and scalable grow system using a raspberrypi pico and standard off the shelf sensors and components. 

#### **present state** 
_includes nutrient mixing capabilities and monitor of the following sensors._
 *  air temp
 *  water temp
 *  humidity
 *  volatile organic compounds
 *  carbon dioxide
 *  soil moisture - [see irrigation](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/picopasco/blob/main/readme.md#irrigation)
 *  tds
 *  ec
 *  pH 
  
   **_see [vids](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/picopasco/blob/main/readme.md#vids) and [picts](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/picopasco/blob/main/readme.md#picts)     for more details._**

## features
- ### nutrient mixing 
four liquid reservoirs using relay triggered solenoid valves for mixing water with up to three nutrients.  User inputs nutrient tank capacity, target EC/TDS, nutrient mix ratios, and mixt interval then the system automatically mixes and fills the tank. Mix may also be triggered externally for point of use.
- ### water quality
The tds/ec sensor can be used as a continuous monitor to ensure the water quality is within the target range and compensate for drift by adding water or nutrients.  
- ### irrigation
moisture sensor monitors the grow media and can trigger irrigation. The nutrient mix can then be used to irrigate multiple grow mediums like hydroponic, aquaponic, or terrestial systems. See [picopasco-water](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/picopasco-water) for controlling irrigation based on moisture sensor feedback.
- ### air quality*
includes temperature, humidity, co2, and volatile organic chemical (voc) sensors.

  _*-present state only include closed loop feedback for mixing additional relays may be added to control irrigation, air quality, and/or lighting_

- ### power
  * #### specifications
    * quiescent (sensor only) - 0.25 watt 
    * maximum (all valves open with sensors scanning) - 4.00 watts* _*operation limited to 1 pump at a time with relay triggering 1.75 watts_
  * #### requirements 
    * ##### supply
      * **on grid:** ac to 5 volts transformer 5 watts
      * **off grid** solar battery bank approximate 15 watts >=15000 mah

*  ### vids
    *  example of runtime [firmware output](https://youtu.be/fia2N3TB2j8)
    *  testing minimum [response time of relays](https://youtu.be/YmTmU25x0V8). 3 ms is the mininum trigger dwell otherwise relays fail to actuate mechanically.
    *  [max power consumed](https://youtube.com/shorts/H6yiRs7PBLs?feature=share) 350 ma @ 5 volts [1.5 watt] during dry pump cycling.
    *  [initial power on test](https://youtu.be/p2OLT5P7gyc) failed to stop pumping due to a partial vacuum build up induced syphoning effect. 
        - solved with shorter tube length and shorter elevation head.
        - optional [solenoid shut off valve](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/picopasco/blob/main/readme.md#optional) in ```<AND>``` with pump SPST relay NO trigger will provide a failsafe engineering control.
